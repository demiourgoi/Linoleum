# Developer guide

## Setup

Prerequisites:

- Container runtime:
  - For windows: [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation)
  - For Ubuntu

```bash
sudo snap install docker-credential-pass --beta
sudo apt install gnupg2 pass
# if the credential store itÂ´s not initialized on `make compose/start`
# https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers/issues/140
systemctl stop docker
rm ~/.docker/config.json
systemctl start docker
```

- `make`

Also install `sscheck-core` in your local maven repo, see [linoleum-ltlss.yml](../.github/workflows/linoleum-ltlss.yml) for how this works on Github actions

## Local fakes

Use the Makefile to launch the local service targets

```bash
# see all targets
make

# launch local services without auth
# this resets the previous state of all services
make compose/start

# Send some traces: this also creates the Kafka topic, otherwise the job fails
cd ../sim_file_replayer && make run

make run 2>&1 | tee run.log

# delete all containers
make compose/stop
```

and then:
 
- See Jaeger UI at http://localhost:16686
- See Kafka UI at  http://localhost:9090
- Install and launch [MongoDB Compass UI](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass), connecting to the URI `mongodb://localhost:27017`.

Note on a remove SSH session with VsCode this works because VsCode auto forwards all the corresponding ports, check the "Ports" section of VsCode to debug potentially missing ports

## Run a simple simulation

```bash
make compose/start

# one shell
cd ../maude
rm -rf json_tmp &&  ./generate.sh 10 json_tmp

# another shell
cd ../sim_file_replayer
## make run SIM_FILE_PATH=$(pwd)/../maude/json_tmp/trace0.jsonl
make run SIM_FILE_DIR_PATH=$(pwd)/../maude/json_tmp

# NOTE: will fail if the source Kafka topic it's not created. The OTEL collector
#       creates the topic on the first replay
# NOTE: for small trace batches (e.g. 10) we have to run the replayer twice to
#       get a second Kafka message with the batch of topic, so Linoleum actually
#       evaluates the first batch. This could be improved tunning the Flink job parameters
make run 2>&1 | tee run.log
```

### Simple local benchmarking

A _crude_ local benchmarking can be run as follows. 

The sim file replayer [doesn't scale well](https://github.com/demiourgoi/Linoleum/issues/7), so we cannot replay more than 100 sim files at once. So here we replay 100 sim files with 12 spans each 10 times, and then launch Linoleum, that starts from the start of the Kafka topic and catches up. Note after a new `make compose/start` the Kafka topic for the spans it's missing, until the replayer sends some traces and the OTEL collector creates it, only then we can launch Linoleum ---otherwise the Flink job will fail due to an error connecting to the Kafka source. 


```bash
# generate 100 sim files
cd ../maude
rm -rf json_tmp &&  ./generate.sh 100 json_tmp_100

# replay the 100 sim files 10 times
cd ../sim_file_replayer
for i in $(seq 10)
do
  echo "Replaying file $i"
  MAX_THREAD_POOL_SIZE=10000 SIM_FILE_DIR_PATH=$(pwd)/../../../../maude/json_tmp_100 ./app/bin/app 2>&1 > "replay_$i.log" 
done
## ensure there are no replay errors
grep xcept replay_*

make run 2>&1 | tee run_1000.log
```

Note this only processes 900 traces due to the windowing configuration we have in Flink.  
With Flink local mode on an AMD Ryzen Embedded V1605B 3.6 GHz with 4 cores and 16 GB RAM, Linoleum processes 900 traces in 5 seconds (substracting the Flink job setup time).

```bash

```

## VsCode

I was able to debug on VsCode with [Gradle support for Metals](https://scalameta.org/metals/docs/build-tools/gradle/).  
Had to `delete app/src/main/java/io/jaegertracing/api_v3/QueryServiceGrpc.java` as Metals was failing to find the annotation after we commented the dependency `implementation "javax.annotation:javax.annotation-api:1.3.2"`: that's fine as we don't call Jaeger directly anymore

- The build currently only works for JDK8, for JDK 17 or 19 serialization fails with `java.lang.reflect.InaccessibleObjectException` in `com.twitter.chill.java.ArraysAsListSerializer` at `org.apache.flink.api.java.typeutils.runtime.kryo.FlinkChillPackageRegistrar.registerSerializers`. This is a problem known on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-33161 with a workaround of settings some runtime flag. Note `make run` works because gradle is setup with `javaVersion = '1.8'`, that is the version used by the Flink project template. For now I'm configuring metals to use JDK 8 (for Windows get it from https://learn.microsoft.com/es-es/java/openjdk/download#openjdk-8), adding it to `.vscode\settings.json` (setting `"metals.javaHome": "C:\\Users\\...`, note the usage of `\\` for path components).
- Run the VsCode command `Metals: Import build` to setup the build, and use the launch configs on `.vscode\launch.json`. 
- Remember to use the same JVM options as in `app\build.gradle` for the launch configs.
- Flink web UI at http://localhost:8081/#/overview only works from `make run`, not from VsCode. This is probably an issue with Windows.

## How to build the code

Use make to build the code, that configured using gradle.

```bash
make build
make release
```

## Troubleshooting 

### Podman containers fail to start

If you get an error with podman retry restarting the VM with `podman machine stop && podman machine start`.
